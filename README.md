## Overview

The "Append Jira Details to PR" GitHub Action is designed to enhance your Pull Request (PR) workflow by seamlessly integrating Jira details into your PRs. This action performs three main updates:

1. **Update PR Title:** It updates the title of the Pull Request to include the Jira ID and Summary.
2. **Append Jira Description:** It appends the Jira description to the body of the Pull Request, providing additional context.
3. **Update Label:** It updates the label on the PR based on the Jira Issue Type & Fix Versions.

This action simplifies the collaboration between your GitHub repository and Jira project, ensuring that your PRs are enriched with relevant Jira information.

## Requirements

To ensure that Jira issues are correctly linked, the Jira Identifier must be included in one of the following:

1. **PR Title**: The Jira Identifier should be mentioned in the title of the pull request. For example: `Fix issue with login ABC-1`.

2. **Branch Name**: The Jira Identifier should be part of the branch name associated with the pull request. Examples include:
   - `ABC-1`
   - `fix/ABC-1`
